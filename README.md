Boost your productivity and make your life easier as an Odoo developer

[Homepage](https://odoo-ide.com) | [Blog](https://odoo-ide.com/blog) | [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/odoo-ide/vscode-odoo/issues)

This extension is in the early stages of development. A lot of features are missing compared to the [PyCharm plugin for Odoo](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13499-odoo).

## Features
- Resolve odoo module imports.


## Installation
- Install this extension from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trinhanhngoc.vscode-odoo).
- Open Settings and set `Python Language Server` to `None` for your Odoo workspaces because this extension uses a custom language server (based on [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)) for the Odoo framework.
